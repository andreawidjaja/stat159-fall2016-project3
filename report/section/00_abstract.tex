\section{Abstract}
This report is the third and final project of STAT 159, Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science, taught by Professor Gaston Sanchez in the fall of 2016 at UC Berkeley. STAT 159 focuses on the collaborative work and the ability to reproduce valuable data.

This paper consists of six parts: abstract, introduction, data, methods, analysis, results, conclusion. We used College Scorecard data, which was developed by the U.S. Department of Education (under Obama’s Administration) to provide “key indicators about the cost and value of institutions across the country to help students choose a school that is well-suited to meet their needs, priced affordably, and is consistent with their educational and career goals”. We used the data set corresponding to the 2014-2015 academic year because it is the most recent dataset we have access to. Meanwhile, in order to understand each variable, we referred to the data dictionary provided by College Scorecard.
